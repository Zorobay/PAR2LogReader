## Setup

1. Install Poetry dependency manager: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. From the repository root, run `poetry install`
   3. This creates a new poetry environment and installs all required dependencies

## Running

For development it is recommended to use `PyCharm` to run the project from the `main.py` file.

The project can also be run from the terminal using `poetry run python .\main.py`

## Building executable

To build a single file executable, run `.\build.bat`. This creates an executable file in the `/dist` folder and copies assets.
